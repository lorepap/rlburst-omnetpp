# Omnet++ simulation files

This repository provides the instructions and files required to run the simulations and extract the results. We use [Omnet++ simulator](https://omnetpp.org/) and INET framework to run the simulations. [Omnet++ manual](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/manual/) and its examples are good references for introduction to the simulator. We ran our simulations on Ubuntu machines (version: 18.04) so all the commands are for Ubuntu. To run the simulations, you should follow the following steps:

* [Step 1: Install dependencies](#step-1-installing-dependencies) (~ 10 minutes)
* [Step 2: Install Omnet++](#step-2-installing-omnet)  (~ 15 minutes)
* [Step 3: Clone the repository](#step-3-cloning-the-repository) (~ 5 minutes)
* [Step 4: Build the project](#step-4-building-the-project) (~ 20 minutes)
* [Step 5: Downloading distribution files](#step-5-downloading-distribution-files) (~ 15 minutes)
* [Step 6: Run the simulations and extract the results](#small-scale-simulations-extra-step-for-evaluation-in-a-short-time) (This step can take from a few hours to one/two weeks depending on the simulations that you run)

### Step 1: Installing dependencies

To successfully install Omnet++ and run the simulations, execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
sudo apt-get install -y flex bison
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev
sudo apt install -y sqlite3
sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y zip unzip
```

Make sure you have python3 installed (if not, run ```sudo apt-get install -y python3```). If it is installed and accessible in "/usr/bin/python3" run the following: 

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/python
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
sudo apt install -y python3-numpy
sudo apt-get install -y python3-matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Installing Omnet++

The complete instructions for installing Omnet++ can be found in [Omnet++ installation guide](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf). **In case you already have the simulator installed, you can skip this step.** To install Omnet++ on an Ubuntu OS, you should run the following commands:

```
wget https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp/releases/download/omnetpp-5.6.2/omnetpp-5.6.2-src-linux.tgz
tar xvfz omnetpp-5.6.2-src-linux.tgz
cd omnetpp-5.6.2/
. setenv
```

For the next line we are assuming that you have extracted omnet in $HOME. If this is not true, replace $HOME with the path you have extracted the omnet files to.

```
echo "export PATH=$HOME/omnetpp-5.6.2/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

```
source ~/.bashrc
./configure WITH_QTENV=no WITH_OSG=no WITH_OSGEARTH=no
```

In case, the configure command printed out that "omnetpp-5.6.2/bin" is not added to your path, close and re-open your terminal and run the configure command again. If you are not using GUI, reboot your system using ```sudo reboot```. Make sure you get the **"Your PATH contains /opt/omnetpp-5.6.2/bin. Good!"** message in the configuration process before moving forward.

```
make
```

### Step 3: Cloning the repository

To clone the repository, run the following script:

```
git clone https://github.com/hopnets/practical_deflection.git
```

### Step 4: Building the project

We have provided a ```build.sh``` shell script to simplify this process. To build the project modules and download the distribution files, run the following scripts:

```
cd practical_deflection/Omnet_Sims/
bash build.sh
```

### Step 5: Downloading distribution files

To download the distribution files, make sure that you are in the right directory ("practical_deflection/Omnet_Sims") and then run the following commands:

```
cd dc_simulations/simulations/sims
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Small-scale simulations: Extra step for evaluation in a short time

Every scenario with [large-scale simulation](#step-6-running-the-large-scale-simulations-and-extracting-the-results) configurations takes days or even weeks to complete. Accordingly, we are providing a small-scale sample with 1Gbps links for those interested in evaluating the code in a short time. First, make sure that you are in the right directory ("practical_deflection/Omnet_Sims/dc_simulations/simulations/sims") and then use the following commands to extract the distribution files:

```
bash extract_dist_files_LS_1Gbps.sh
./run_1G.sh 
```

The commands above, download the distribution files for the small-scale simulations and simulate the following scenarios:

* DCTCP + ECMP
* DCTCP + DIBS
* DCTCP + Sample Deflection
* DCTCP + Vertigo
* DCTCP + Quantile_PD
* DCTCP + Dist_PD

We run each technique under 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, and 95% load. Every scenario is expected to take less than 30 minutes. After the simulations are over, our bash script automatically runs the Python code, prints the results, plots the figures, and saves them in the ./figs directory. The sample output printed should be as follows:

The results above illustrate that Simple Deflection performs comparably to DIBS and achieves 2.6x lower mean QCT than ECMP under 55% load. With DCTCP under 95% load, Preemptive Deflection achieves the middle ground between Vertigo and Simple Deflection and achieves 24% and 43% lower mean QCT than ECMP and Simple Deflection, respectively.

### Step 6: Running the large-scale simulations and extracting the results

The config files for large-scale simulations can be used for evaluating Simple Deflection, quantile-based Preemptive Deflection, distribution-based Preemptive Deflection, Vertigo, DIBS, and ECMP while using TCP, DCTCP, Swift, and Bolt as the transport protocol. To run the large-scale simulations, first, make sure that you are in the right directory ("practical_deflection/Omnet_Sims/dc_simulations/simulations/sims") and then use the following commands to download the distribution files:

```
bash extract_dist_files_LS.sh
```

After the distribution files are extracted, run the following commands based on the transport protocol for which you want to run your simulations:

**TCP:**

```
./run_50_bg_dqps_tcp.sh
```

**DCTCP:**

```
./run_50_bg_dqps_dctcp.sh
```

**Swift:**

```
./run_50_bg_dqps_swift.sh
```

**Bolt:**

```
./run_50_bg_dqps_bolt.sh
```

The commands above run each technique under 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, and 95% load. After the simulations are over, our bash script automatically runs the Python code, prints the results, plots the figures, and saves them in the ./figs directory. Every scenario is expected to take less than 3 days. Accordingly, it would take less than 18 days for the simulations related to each transport protocol to be finished. We refer you to the **small-scale simulations** section if you would like to see some results in a shorter time.

### Run large-scale simulations under other scenarios [Optional]

If you want to run Simple Deflection, quantile-based Preemptive Deflection, distribution-based Preemptive Deflection, Vertigo, DIBS, ECMP, and AIFO under other scenarios, make sure that you are in the right directory ("practical_deflection/Omnet_Sims/dc_simulations/simulations/sims") and extract the distribution files depending on the simulations you want to run (**Make sure to execute only one of these commands as running both of them will overwrite some distribution files and you will face errors while running simulations**):

```
bash extract_dist_files_LS.sh # Run this if you want to run leaf-spine simulations.
```
```
bash extract_dist_files_FatTree.sh # Run this if you want to run fat-tree simulations.
```

After the distribution files are extracted, you can use the provided bash scripts to run the large-scale simulations for different incast arrival rates (dqps), flow sizes, and scales. Additionally, you can run the simulations for 100 Gbps link rates, fat-tree topology, and component analysis. The list of the provided bash scripts is as below:

* **Different arrival rates with 25%, 50%, and 75% background load and 10/40 Gbps links**
